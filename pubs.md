**Port's war: a case of business political success**<br>
[Agenda Política, 2023](https://www.agendapolitica.ufscar.br/index.php/agendapolitica/article/view/791)


This paper contributes to the research agenda on the role of interest groups in decision-making processes  and,  more  specifically,  around  the conditions  that  favor  or  hinder  the  achievement  of  business political success. A case study was carried out on the Senate Resolution Project n. 72, of 2010, which aimed to zero  the ICMS  rate  on  imported  products, and  thus  put  an  end  to  what  became  known  asthe “ports’ war”. Based on the congruence analysis methodology (Blatter and Blume 2010), we assessed the extent to which the theoretical  expectations  outlined  on  the  relationships  between  the  decision-making  context,  the  strategies adopted and the (un)success obtained were reflected in the empirical case studied. It was possible to characterize the case of the ports’ was as an unlikely case, since the most common cases of business success, especially in tax matters, are those in which the business community acts defensively. The analysis of the approval of PRS 72/10 suggests that the role of the executive administration was decisive for this positive outcome.

**Gramsci in refractions: the interpretation of Fernando Henrique Cardoso**, coauthored with Daniela Mussi (UFRJ). <br>
[DADOS](https://www.scielo.br/j/dados/) 68(2), 2025, forthcoming


This article reconstructs Fernando Henrique Cardoso’s political thought during the Brazilian military dictatorship and democratic transition (1964-1988), focusing on his interpretation and use of Antonio Gramsci’s ideas to analyze state formation, social classes and politics in Brazil. The paper argues that the Gramscian concepts are central to Cardoso’s political thought in three phases of Gramscian refraction: (i) between 1964 and 1974, in the thesis of the Brazilian bourgeoisie's dependent hegemony; (ii) between 1974 and 1983, in the argument of the Brazilian state as the “Modern Prince” as a concept for the analysis of the agrarian-industrial-military coalition in the post-1964 period; and (iii) from 1983 to 1988, in the definition of the Brazilian economic and military elites’ behavior as a authoritarianscletortic transformism in the face of the pressures for the democratization of the political regime.

**Industrial entrepreneurs in Dilma Rousseff’s first term (2011-2014): an analysis from the newspaper Valor Econômico**, co-authored with Gabriel Nunes de Oliveira (USP)<br>
[Revista Brasileira de Ciência Política, 2022](https://www.scielo.br/j/rbcpol/a/qJkmrFTQFT7hrkXcb8nKdrG/)


This article contributes to the debate about how to interpret Dilma Rousseff’s governments and the crisis that led to her impeachment in 2016. The starting point is André Singer’s hypothesis about the “productivist coalition” and the political shift of industrial entrepreneurs. Based on the analysis of statements by business leaders in the newspaper, Valor Econômico, between 2011 and 2014, we aimed to verify whether a change in the industrial bourgeoisie’s political position in fact occurred. The statements were classified as favorable, contrary or neutral to Rousseff’s government and its economic policy. The data reveal that the president had broad support from industrialists until the first half of 2013. However, from the second half until the end of 2014, contrary manifestations predominated. The results suggest that the political behavior of industrialists cannot be explained merely as a response to adverse economic conditions.
