**Industrial entrepreneurs in Dilma Rousseff’s first term (2011-2014): an analysis from the newspaper Valor Econômico**, co-authored with Gabriel Nunes de Oliveira (USP)<br>
[Revista Brasileira de Ciência Política, 2022.](https://www.scielo.br/j/rbcpol/a/qJkmrFTQFT7hrkXcb8nKdrG/)


This article contributes to the debate about how to interpret Dilma Rousseff’s governments and the crisis that led to her impeachment in 2016. The starting point is André Singer’s hypothesis about the “productivist coalition” and the political shift of industrial entrepreneurs. Based on the analysis of statements by business leaders in the newspaper, Valor Econômico, between 2011 and 2014, we aimed to verify whether a change in the industrial bourgeoisie’s political position in fact occurred. The statements were classified as favorable, contrary or neutral to Rousseff’s government and its economic policy. The data reveal that the president had broad support from industrialists until the first half of 2013. However, from the second half until the end of 2014, contrary manifestations predominated. The results suggest that the political behavior of industrialists cannot be explained merely as a response to adverse economic conditions.



##### Working Papers
<br>
**Gramsci in refractions: the interpretation of Fernando Henrique Cardoso**, coauthored with Daniela Mussi (UFRJ). <br>
Submitted to Revista DADOS, 2023.


This article reconstructs Fernando Henrique Cardoso’s political thought during the Brazilian military dictatorship and democratic transition (1964-1988), focusing on his interpretation and use of Antonio Gramsci’s ideas to analyze state formation, social classes and politics in Brazil. The paper argues that the Gramscian concepts are central to Cardoso’s political thought in three phases of Gramscian refraction: (i) between 1964 and 1974, in the thesis of the Brazilian bourgeoisie's dependent hegemony; (ii) between 1974 and 1983, in the argument of the Brazilian state as the “Modern Prince” as a concept for the analysis of the agrarian-industrial-military coalition in the post-1964 period; and (iii) from 1983 to 1988, in the definition of the Brazilian economic and military elites’ behavior as a authoritarianscletortic transformism in the face of the pressures for the democratization of the political regime.
