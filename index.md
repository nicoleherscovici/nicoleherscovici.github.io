#### About me

Hello! I’m a prospective PhD student with a Master's in Political Science from the University of São Paulo. My research so far has been focused on the political attitudes of economic elites towards democracy, the relationship between antidemocratic elite's reaction and redistributive threats, and the rise of the far-right in Brazil. In my spare time I cycle, run, watch trashy reality shows, and take pictures of my dog Bisteca. Feel free to contact me at nicoleherscovici[at]gmail.com
