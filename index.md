#### About me

Hello! I’m a Brazilian political science master’s student at University of São Paulo. My research so far has focused on the political behaviour of economic elites, the relationship between democracy and economic cycles and the various causes of contemporary democratic backsliding. In my spare time I cycle, watch trashy reality shows, and walk with my dog Bisteca. For this year, I'm planning on applying to a PhD program in the US. Feel free to contact me at nicoleherscovici[at]gmail.com
